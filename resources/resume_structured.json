      "description": "Designed and implemented a scalable microservices-based reservation system for restaurants using Spring Boot & AngularJS. Deployed backend micro services across three separate EC2 instances to distribute load and improve scalability. Hosted the Angular frontend on an NGINX web server for efficient static content delivery. Used service discovery (Eureka), centralized configuration (Spring Cloud Config), and OAuth 2.0 for secure inter-service communication. Integrated a Python-based AI micro service using the Groq LLM for natural language table reservations via chat-based UI. Developed REST and gRPC endpoints with complete API documentation and exposed AI features via HTTP client for frontend integration. Implemented event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka to produce messages and consume between micro services.",
